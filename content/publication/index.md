I conducted a research project in collaboration with the TAMU NeuroErgonomics lab, focusing on human-robot trust dynamics. The project involved conducting an experiment that analyzed heart rate, eye movement, fNirs (brain-wave) and subjective metrics to make conclusions about trust dynamics in teams composing of entirely humans as opposed to teams composed of humans and robot-agents. The findings of this research was presented at the HFES convention in 2023. Throughout this project, I was introduced to many technologies and areas of research and became a much better software developer. Additionally, this oppurtunity was a great introduction to the research community. This was done with the Neuroergonomics lab at Texas A&M (which has since been relocated to the University of Wisconsin-Madison).
