- As a member of the inaugural internship cohort in the Austin office, I had the opportunity to work with a cutting-edge tech stack within the API development and architecture team. My key contributions included:

- **AWS Infrastructure Provisioning:** Leveraged Terraform, Java, and Python to provision and manage AWS infrastructure, incorporating technologies such as EC2, MSK (Kafka), EKS, and ECS to design and implement a robust big data pipeline.
  
- **Log Extraction and Analysis:** Utilized Lua and Golang to extract and process logs from an API Gateway (Kong), enhancing system monitoring and performance analysis.
  
- **Analytics Dashboard Development:** Developed an interactive analytics dashboard for software performance using React, Highcharts, and JavaScript/TypeScript, providing actionable insights to the team and end-users.
